# Quantum PDE Solver

## Description
This project demonstrates solving basic partial differential equations using a quantum linear system solver. PDEs are converted into linear systems and solved using the HHL algorithm with Qiskit.

## Contents
Each PDE is implemented in a separate Python file, and all equations are solved through a single main file called `quantum_solver.py`.

## Usage
Run the solver using:
```bash
python quantum_solver.py

or

python quantum_variational_solver.py
